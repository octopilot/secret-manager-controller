# SecretManagerConfig for IDAM Service - Development Environment (ArgoCD)
#
# This example shows how to configure the controller for ArgoCD users.
# The controller references an ArgoCD Application resource instead of FluxCD GitRepository.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. An ArgoCD Application resource named "idam-app" in the "argocd" namespace
# 2. The Application should reference a Git repository
# 3. GCP project with Secret Manager API enabled
# 4. Service account with Secret Manager Admin role
# 5. kustomize binary must be available in the controller container
#
# Note: ArgoCD Application support requires the controller to access the Git repository
# directly. The controller will extract the Git source information from the Application
# and attempt to access the repository. You may need to configure Git credentials
# or ensure the repository is accessible from the controller pod.
#
# Directory structure expected:
# microservices/idam/deployment-configuration/profiles/dev/
#   ├── kustomization.yaml      # Contains secretGenerator configuration
#   ├── application.properties
#   └── application.secrets.env  # SOPS-encrypted secrets

  # Kustomize path - path to kustomization.yaml (relative to Git repository root)

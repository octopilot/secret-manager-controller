# SecretManagerConfig for IDAM Service - Development Environment (Kustomize Mode)
#
# This example uses kustomize build mode to extract secrets from the generated
# Kubernetes Secret resources. This supports kustomize overlays, patches, and generators.
# Works with any GitOps tool (FluxCD, ArgoCD, etc.)
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. A Flux GitRepository resource named "mysystem-manifests" in the "flux-system" namespace
# 2. The GitRepository should point to your application repository
# 3. GCP project with Secret Manager API enabled
# 4. Service account with Secret Manager Admin role
# 5. kustomize binary must be available in the controller container
#
# Directory structure expected:
# microservices/myapp/deployment-configuration/profiles/dev/
#   ├── kustomization.yaml      # Contains secretGenerator configuration
#   ├── application.properties
#   └── application.secrets.env  # SOPS-encrypted secrets
#
# The controller will run `kustomize build` on the specified path and extract
# secrets from the generated Secret resources. This ensures overlays, patches,
# and generator modifications are included.
#
# Secrets will be synced to GCP Secret Manager with names:
# - myapp-dev-database-url
# - myapp-dev-api-key
# - myapp-dev-jwt-secret

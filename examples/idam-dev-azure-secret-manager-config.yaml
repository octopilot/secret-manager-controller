# SecretManagerConfig for IDAM Service - Development Environment (Azure Key Vault)
#
# This example shows how to configure the controller to sync secrets to Azure Key Vault
# using Workload Identity - the recommended approach for AKS clusters.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. AKS cluster with Workload Identity enabled
# 2. Azure AD application created with Key Vault access
# 3. Federated credential configured for the service account
# 4. Service account annotation set in config/rbac/serviceaccount.yaml:
#    azure.workload.identity/client-id: APPLICATION_ID
# 5. FluxCD GitRepository resource named "mysystem-manifests" in "flux-system" namespace
# 6. Azure Key Vault created with appropriate access policies
#
# Directory structure expected:
# microservices/myapp/deployment-configuration/profiles/dev/
#   ├── kustomization.yaml      # Contains secretGenerator configuration
#   ├── application.properties
#   └── application.secrets.env  # SOPS-encrypted secrets

  # Secrets sync configuration
  secrets:

    # Controller will run `kustomize build` on this path and extract secrets

    # Secret name prefix for Azure Key Vault
    prefix: myapp-dev
    # Optional: Secret suffix
    # suffix: -prod

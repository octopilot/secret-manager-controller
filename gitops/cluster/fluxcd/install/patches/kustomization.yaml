# Kustomize configuration for FluxCD patches
# These patches modify FluxCD-managed resources to enable integration with
# the secret-manager-controller running in octopilot-system namespace.
#
# Usage:
#   kubectl apply -k gitops/cluster/fluxcd/install/
#
# Note: Patches are applied automatically via the parent kustomization.yaml
# in gitops/cluster/fluxcd/install/. The NetworkPolicy patch is applied
# using Kustomize patches with target selector.

apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

namespace: flux-system

# Note: Namespace label is now defined in config/namespace.yaml (DRY principle)
# The parent kustomization.yaml includes it via: ../../../config/namespace.yaml
# This file is kept for reference but no longer includes namespace-label.yaml

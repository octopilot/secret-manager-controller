# Note: microscaler-system namespace is created by Kind cluster setup (scripts/setup_kind.py)
# and is not managed by Tilt to ensure it's always available
# The namespace is created with proper labels for FluxCD NetworkPolicy namespaceSelector matching
# See: scripts/setup_kind.py create_microscaler_system_namespace() function

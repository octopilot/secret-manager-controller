# Pact Mode Patch
# Adds environment variables to route cloud provider requests to Pact mock servers
# This enables testing without real cloud accounts
# 
# NOTE: This patch is ENABLED for Tilt development.
# The controller should use real cloud provider APIs in production.
# 
# To disable Pact mode, comment out the patch below
# or use a kustomize overlay (see config/deployment/README.md)

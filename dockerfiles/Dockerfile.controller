# Production Dockerfile for Secret Manager Controller
# Multi-stage build that compiles the Rust binary inside Docker
# This is used for production builds with docker buildx / op build.
#
# RUST_BUILDER is injected by Skaffold when this image is built via skaffold.yaml
# (which declares rust-builder-base-image as a required dependency with the alias
# RUST_BUILDER).  When building standalone (e.g. direct docker build), the default
# falls back to the published ghcr.io image.

# unmounted; otherwise it disappears when this RUN layer completes.
